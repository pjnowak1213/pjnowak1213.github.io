            I am passionate about modern business practices, agility and helping companies move from a traditional project management / development to agile. I enjoy making peoples lives better by transforming their organization and making it a better place to work.

            I have been in the software development industry for over 15 years. I started my career as a developer in a waterfall environment. Shortly after our team brought in an agile coach to coach us in agility and Scrum. Since then I have become passionate in coaching others in Scrum, Kanban or any other Agile framework.
