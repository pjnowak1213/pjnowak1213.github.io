<h3>The Start</h3>

<p>So you have your team selected and in place, and they are up and running within the first sprint.  The team is excited and enthusiastic to be working in a new environment.  However you slowly start to see the mode change on your team to being a little more resistant, this is normal.  If you look at the Satir change model, the introducing of Scrum is the “Foreign Element” and as you’re team progress they will go through the remainder of the stages.  By being aware of these stages and what to expect in each of them you will be able to guide your team through them.

<h3>Resistance</h3>

<p>During this stage the team will mostly likely reject the different parts of Scrum.  You might hear statements like:

<ul>
    <li>“Why are we having all of these meeting?”</li>
    <li>“The daily scrum is a waste of time.”</li>
</ul>

It is crucial that during this stage we adhere to the principle and framework that is laid out in the Scrum Guide.  The team does not yet have the foundation or fully understand all the whys to be able to effectively change Scrum. </p>

<h3>Chaos</h3>

<p>After resistance chaos will start it occur.  The loss of individual identity as the team starts to move towards cross functional individuals, might trigger emotions of vulnerability and bring out childlike behaviors.  You might hear statements like:

<ul>
<li>“I am unable to breakdown my work anymore and I know it will take 40 hours”</li>
<li>“Why can’t I just do it my way”</li>
<li>“I can’t help with that task, that is not my expertise”</li>
</ul>
These are all signs of self-preservation, and explain to your team that it is important to be transparent with our work.  Remind them that we value expertise and knowledge but it is important that we share knowledge amongst team members to better the team as a whole.  During this stage you should expect performance and velocity to drop and for PBI’s to not be completed in a sprint.  It is important for to try not to implement any kind of silver bullet solution to fix this, it will only drive the team farther apart.  Emotions and fear are usually high during this stage, it is important that you acknowledge that and help each team member confront their fear and emotions.  I have also seen teams turn into what can only be described as high school clicks, with very strong pair relationships and not strong team relationships.  Try to encourage pairing of different specialties and clicks to build strong relationships amongst other team members.
</p>

<h3>Integration</h3>
<p>During this stage the team will start to form and roles will start to blend.  They will see the value of having a cross functional team and T-shaped people.   You should see a lot of pairing going on during this stage as they become more cross functional.  Roles on the team will start to blur and you the conversation will start change.  You should being hearing a lot of “we” type language.  There is not much to do at this stage other then let the team go and encourage them to continue their pairing and knowledge gathering.</p>

<h3>New Status Quo</h3>
<p>At this stage the team should have taken to Scrum and they should on a good path to becoming a high performing team.  During this stage it is important to continue to support and encourage the team.  Help them continue to learn and grow in different areas that they are interested in.  Also watch that the team does not fall back into a bad behaves from any of the earlier stages and if they do encourage and help them through it.</p>

<h3>In the End</h3>
<p>Each individual on the team is unique in their own way, and an approach that works with one might not work with another.  Keep trying different approaches until you find one that works for each individual.  And keep in mind what Peter Block said “People don’t resist change; they resist coercion”.</p>
