<p>Have you ever heard “Done but not tested”, or “It is 80% done” for the past 3 weeks?  How did that make you feel?  If you are the individual asking you probably lost some trust amongst the team.  And if you are the individual that was asked, you probably feel some frustration as you might not have a good idea as to what done is.  So what does it mean to be done?</p>

<p>We all have a different meaning of what done and quality means, on top of that it could vary greatly based on industry and application.  For instance, a website quality might mean it is visually appealing and meets user experience guidelines, where an internal application that is used by a handful of users might not have as strict of a guideline on the user interface.  However, quality is defined for your product it has to be consistent.  We can do this by creating a Definition of Done (DoD).  The DoD is a contract of what quality means between the Scrum Team and the business.</p>

<p>When first creating a DoD for your product there are a couple of rules you should follow:

<ul>
<li>Binary done or not done</li>
<li>Detailed (Unit Tested instead of Tested)</li>
<li>Quantified (80% Unit Tested)</li>
<li>As detailed as possible</li>
</ul>
</p>



<p>Your definition of done for a new team should start off small, and as the product grows your DoD should get more detailed and defined as well.  For example, for a new product you might only have a few items on your DoD.</p>

<p>
Example 1:

<ul>
<li>Code is 80% Unit tested</li>
<li>Meets all acceptance criteria</li>
<li>Product Owner has reviewed it</li>
<li>At the end of every sprint during the retrospective you should be reviewing your DoD and if needed modifying or adding to it.  Over time that same DoD </li><li>might look something like this:</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Example 2:

<ul>
<li>Code is 90% Unit tested</li>
<li>Meets all acceptance criteria</li>
<li>Product Owner has reviewed it</li>
<li>All web pages’ load in under 3 seconds</li>
<li>Web pages adhere to the Design Guide</li>
<li>Functional tests are automated</li>
<li>Deployed to the UAT environment</li>
<li>Tested in the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explore</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Watch out for too many items on your DoD, if you have say 50 items on there the chances of having the team go through each and making sure that they have meet them goes down.  Also watch out for the team arguing over the same item on the DoD every time, chances are it is not defined enough.</p>

<p>Now that we have a Definition of Done and we have defined what quality means for our product we can move away from answers like “Done but not tested” or “Done,Done” to either “Done” or “Not Done”.   Doing so will once again build trust between the Development team and the Business. By having a common understanding of what quality is.  Plus this gives the business what they really wanted Done software.</p>
