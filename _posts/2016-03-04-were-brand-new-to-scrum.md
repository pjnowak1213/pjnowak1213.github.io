<p>Understanding the concepts of scrum can be easy, however actually doing Scrum can be hard.  Like Albert Einstein said you are going to make mistakes along thimagese way, that is okay as long as you remember that Scrum is a journey.</p>

<p>The most important piece of advice that I can give you is to understand the values and principals of Scrum, why we do do what we do.  This will help you when you communicate outside of the Scrum team especially to the business.</p>

<p>Don’t focus to much on the “How” or the architecture of the Product Backlog Items (P.B.I.) during refinement but the “Why” or the business value of the P.B.I.  Developers have a tendency to solution right away so this can be difficult.  Save the “How” for when you’re working on the P.B.I.</p>

<p>Don’t let your Daily Scrum meetings turn into a status report with each team member reporting to usually the Scrum Master or the Product Owner if he or she attends. The Daily Scrum meeting should be for the Development team to come up with a plan for the next day.</p>

<p>Have a clear Definition of Done (D.O.D.), and adhere to it.  A good D.O.D. will also limit the risk and conflict between the development team and the stake holders.  When your D.O.D. is lacking, quality will go down, and your stake holders will start to lose trust in the team.   You should inspect your D.O.D. at every retrospective and refine it as needed.</p>

<p>Focus on done P.B.I.s during the Sprint Review.  I see a lot of new teams demoing undone work, or work that does not meet there D.O.D., this has risk involved, as the Stake Holders might interpret it as a shippable product.  Don’t hesitate however to speak towards your undone work, just don’t demo it.</p>

<p>Pick one action item to improve upon during your Sprint Retrospective.  The Sprint Retrospective is used to inspect your teams process and try to improve upon it.  I have seen teams loose focus and not improve at all if they have more then one action item to improve upon.</p>

<p>Hopefully these pieces of advice and some mistakes that I have made along the way will help you and your team.  If you have any advice or other mistakes that either you or your team has made please share it with us, we could all benefit from it, and hopefully not make the same mistake.</p>
